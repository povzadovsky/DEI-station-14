  # Server Rules

  Welcome to DEIstation! Playing on this server means you have read and acknowledged your requirement to follow the rules listed below:

  1. No isms.
  Racism, sexism, bigotry of any kind, or any other exclusionary language or behavior will not be tolerated here. That much should be obvious. Anyone caught violating this will almost certainly be punished with a ban immediately with no warning.

  2. Do not metagame.
  Using outside methods of communication in order to convey information about the currently on-going round (such as Discord) is strictly prohibited. You are not permitted to use any knowledge gained while dead or as a ghost/ghost role in order to affect decisions made when you are alive or active in the round.

  3. Do not powergame.
  Our server is intentionally a bit more strict than others on this, and is up to staff interpretation.
