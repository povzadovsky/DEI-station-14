  # Core Rule 13 - Put at least a little effort into your character(s)
  
  Your character needs to be plausible in the world of Space Station 14. This includes using a name that actually sounds like it could be someone's name, as long as it fits within the naming conventions of that species.
  Characters named after real people or famous fictional characters are liable to be AHelped and requested to change. Characters with low-effort roleplay names (e.g. Muh Dick, John Skibidi, etc.) or other silly names like that are liable to be AHelped and requested to change.

  We defer to common sense on this one, so we do not have exact rules or guidelines on this, but if your character gets brought up over AHelp for this rule, it's likely we will just explain why and politely ask you to adjust it next round.
